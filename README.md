# NFL Play Predictor

### By: Jon Hickey

## Executive Summary
The goal of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to predict whether an offensive play will be a run or pass based on in-game features. I will look at which features are most important when predicting a run or pass play, which can be valuable information for a defensive coordinator when it comes to schematics defensive packages.

### Problem Statement
Having an edge is key in the world of sports. Can the likes of game scenarios or pre-snap formations be used to give a defense a hint as to what play will be run next?

### Dataset
My analysis is based on NFL play-by-play data from nflscapR that I converted to be compatable using Python. I am focusing on the years 2018-2020 to capture recent trends in the sport, as the league is always evolving.
